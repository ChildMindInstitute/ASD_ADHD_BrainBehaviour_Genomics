# Genetic decoding and enrichment analysis: Connectome-based symptom mapping and in silico related gene expression in children with autism and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

This contains the scripts used for genetic decoding and enrichment analysis to identify genes that are significantly correlated with functional connectivity maps for the article “Connectome-based symptom mapping and in silico related gene expression in children with autism and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder”. It also provides the gene list derived from Satterstrom et al. (2019) used for genetic enrichment analysis. This list includes genes with higher rate of variance in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism without intellectual disability relative to controls.
